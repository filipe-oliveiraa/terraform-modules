## [v1.0.0] - 2025-07-13

### Changed
- Refactored `snap_start_optimization_status` output to use `length(...) > 0` check instead of null comparison for improved handling of optional SnapStart blocks.
- Updated `vpc_id` output to use indexed access with `length(...) > 0` to safely retrieve VPC ID from optional `vpc_config`, avoiding potential null access issues.
